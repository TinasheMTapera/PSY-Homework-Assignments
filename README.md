# PSY-Homework-Assignments
Documentation of the Rmd notebook of any assignments I can do in R. Allows me time to practice writing up Rmarkdown and regular markdown docs, practice with version control, and document my learning in class.

This git includes homework assignments from the following classes at Drexel University:

* Data Analysis I by Dr. Zoe Zhang (PSY610)
* Psychological Testing & Assessment by Dr. Jen Gallo (PSY380)
