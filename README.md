# PSY-Homework-Assignments
Documentation of the Rmd notebook of any assignments I can do in R. Allows me time to practice writing in markdown and R-markdown docs, practice with version control, and document my learning in class.

This git includes homework assignments from the following classes at Drexel University:

* Data Analysis I by Dr. Zoe Zhang (PSY610)
* Psychological Testing & Assessment by Dr. Jen Gallo (PSY380)
